Hi here is a list of features/things i've implemented/added to the project;

I was aiming for the maximum points.

-On-press on-release hook movement
-3 types of fish:
		-good which gives +1 score point
		-bad which takes one life if it hits you
		-golden which gives 1UP
-Splash screen
-Game over screen
-Lives
-Score
-Highscore, saving and loading through file
-Levels, game gets harder the more you play it
-Random fish movement
-All of the artwork is done uniqe and not copyrighted
-Code is commented so you can better understand it //note message me if you need extra explanation.

Due to general bad performance of java in game making i've excluded animations because they were ruining UX, but i added some noise to the fish movement to make it look more interasting. 

Generally game is fun to play, and it was fun coding it also.
I've tried to make it as best as i can, if i had more time i would have implemented more features for sure. 
That pretty much sums it up.
I hope you like what i made,
have a nice day!
